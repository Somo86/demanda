# DEMANDA (Beta)

Demanda is an e-commerce Ruby on Rails Graphql backend.

It is time to stop using one-size-fits-all solutions and templates that make all stores look the same. Demanda is focused on those people that want to provide their clients unique experiences. We follow the BYOF (Bring your own frontend) approach.

With Demanda you can create your own e-commerce site with Gatsby, Sapper, Nuxt, Gridsome... you name it. And because it's Graphql powered it's very easy for you to use only what you need.

## Where is the admin interface?

There is none. I hate when I have to navigate through an app full of menus and options when I only need a small amount of functionality. Admin/Backend areas should be customised as much as the frontend site is. Every client has different needs. If your client sells just a few products they probably don't need categories so why do we even have to see that in the admin interface?

That does not mean that you should create an admin area from scratch each and every single time. You will, of course, reuse your code. Just don't use the same interface and the same options for every client.
