# DEMANDA (Beta)

Demanda is an E-commerce Ruby on Rails Graphql backend.

It follows the concepts of BYOF (Bring your own frontend) and DTT (Death to templates).

With Demanda you can create your own e-commerce site with Gatsby, Sapper, Nuxt, Gridsome... you name it. And because it's Graphql powered it's very easy to customise to your own needs.
