# DEMANDA (Beta)

Demanda is an e-commerce Ruby on Rails & Graphql powered backend. It also includes an admin frontend that you can use as a reference when you create your own e-commerce site. It uses JWT for authentication.

It is time to stop using one-size-fits-all solutions and templates that make all stores look the same. Demanda is focused on those people that want to provide their clients unique experiences. We follow the BYOF (Bring your own frontend) approach.

With Demanda you can create your own e-commerce site with Gatsby, Sapper, Nuxt, Gridsome... you name it. And because it's Graphql powered it's very easy for you to use only what you need.

Demanda includes an admin example site made with Svelte JS and Apollo client. It uses TailwindCss for layout and styling.
